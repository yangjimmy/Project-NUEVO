# Arduino Firmware v0.9.0

This directory contains the Arduino Mega 2560 firmware for the Project NUEVO robot controller. The firmware is responsible for:

- hard real-time stepper and DC motor servicing
- sensor acquisition and voltage monitoring
- TLV communication with the Raspberry Pi
- system state management and safety policy
- user I/O, discrete LEDs, and NeoPixel state indication

The current `v0.9.0` profile is the first cleaned-up release after the ISR/UART stabilization work. The code is organized so [arduino/arduino.ino](arduino/arduino.ino) reads as the top-level entry point, while detailed ownership lives in modules under [`arduino/src/`](arduino/src/).

## Runtime Overview

The firmware uses three execution layers.

### 1. Hard real-time ISR layer

These paths must stay short and deterministic:

- encoder interrupts for DC motor counting
- `TIMER1_OVF_vect` at `800 Hz`: short DC round-robin latch/apply slot. Process one motor at one time; 200 Hz for each motor.
- `TIMER3_OVF_vect` at `10 kHz`: stepper pulse generation

`Timer4` is PWM hardware only in the current profile. It does not own an ISR.

### 2. Fast cooperative lane in `loop()`

These services run opportunistically every loop pass:

- UART RX drain
- UART TX drain
- DC compute trigger service
- status report chunk emission
- debug log flush

This keeps `loop()` useful without pretending these are fixed-rate periodic tasks.

### 3. Periodic soft tasks

The millis-based scheduler owns jitter-tolerant tasks:

- `taskUART()` at `50 Hz`
- `taskSafety()` at `100 Hz`
- `taskSensors()` at `100 Hz`
- `taskUserIO()` at `20 Hz`
- `StatusReporter::task()` at `1 Hz` when enabled

## Major Subsystems

| Module | Responsibility |
|--------|----------------|
| `SystemManager` | Single source of truth for firmware state and transition policy |
| `MessageCenter` | TLV RX/TX, command routing, telemetry packing, liveness bookkeeping |
| `MotorControlCoordinator` | Mixed ISR/loop DC control pipeline bookkeeping |
| `StepperManager` | 10 kHz stepper service and stepper state |
| `SensorManager` | IMU, ultrasonic, voltage, and mag-calibration handling |
| `UserIO` | Input sampling cache, discrete LEDs, NeoPixel state rendering |
| `StatusReporter` | Human-readable `[SYSTEM] / [TIMING] / [UART]` status output |
| `LoopMonitor` | Timing-budget monitoring and overrun flagging |

For the implementation-level docs, start with [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) and then jump to the subsystem-specific documents listed above.

## State Machine

The firmware state machine lives in `SystemManager`:

- `INIT -> IDLE` after boot completes
- `IDLE -> RUNNING` on `START`
- `RUNNING -> IDLE` on `STOP`
- `ERROR/ESTOP -> IDLE` on `RESET`
- `any -> ESTOP` on emergency stop
- `RUNNING -> ERROR` on heartbeat or battery safety fault

Important battery policy:

- the firmware may enter `RUNNING` with no battery present
- drive/servo enable commands are rejected while battery is absent
- once battery power has been seen during a `RUNNING` session, losing it or crossing safety thresholds trips `ERROR`

## Build and Upload

### Main firmware

```bash
arduino-cli compile --fqbn arduino:avr:mega firmware/arduino
```

### Upload

```bash
arduino-cli upload --fqbn arduino:avr:mega -p /dev/ttyUSB0 firmware/arduino
```

Replace `/dev/ttyUSB0` with the correct port for your machine.

## Configuration

Start with [`arduino/src/config.h`](arduino/src/config.h).

The top of the file contains the settings most users are expected to tune first:

- UART baud rate and heartbeat timeout
- soft task cadences
- status reporter enable/rate
- debug serial rate

The rest of the file covers:

- motor and encoder configuration
- telemetry cadences
- PID defaults
- battery thresholds
- sensor enable flags
- debug/bring-up options

## User I/O Policy

- Discrete LEDs are reserved for user/TLV control.
- The NeoPixel is the automatic system-state indicator.
- The current supported WS2812 profile is a single state-indicator pixel with infrequent updates. Multi-pixel WS2812 animation is not part of the supported `v0.9.0` profile on the Mega 2560.

## Test Sketches

The sketches under [`tests/`](tests/) are standalone bring-up tools for specific subsystems. They are documented in [`tests/README.md`](tests/README.md). The main firmware documentation in this folder describes the production firmware, not every historical test sketch behavior.
